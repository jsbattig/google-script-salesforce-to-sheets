# google-script-salesforce-to-sheets
This repository provides a simple library to extract data from SalesForce into Google Sheets.

For this library to work, once you create the project in your Google Script domain, you need to also create Google Script projects for the projects contained in this repo:

https://github.com/jsbattig/google-appscript-utils

They contain gSheetsHelper and SimpleMap, libraries you will need for the full package to work.
